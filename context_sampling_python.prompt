Storage layer for context map data collected during `pdd generate` operations.

```context_map.schema.json```

% Requirements

1. Accept context data matching the schema and persist to JSON files
2. Support multiple LLM calls per generation; accumulate duration and token counts, keep final char counts
3. Store context files in `.pdd_context/` directory alongside the output file
4. Name files as `<output_basename>.context.<N>.json` where N increases monotonically from 1
5. Retain only the most recent N context files per devunit (default N=5)
6. When retention limit reached, delete the lowest-numbered file before writing
7. Sequence gaps from deletion are acceptable; never renumber existing files
8. Handle errors gracefully: log warnings but never fail the generation

% Contracts

- Input: all fields defined in the JSON schema (required and optional)
- Output: path to written context file, or error indication
- Written files must validate against the schema

% Invariants

- A generation_id maps to exactly one context file
- Context files are valid JSON matching schema_version "1.0"
- File count per devunit never exceeds configured maximum
